        <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Lost/Thread. Follow these rules to keep the forum safe, structured, and engaging.</p>

        <h3>1. Stay On-Topic</h3>
        <p>Lost/Thread is a forum for discussing unexplained phenomena, the otherworld, and related topics. Off-topic discussions will be removed.</p>

        <h3>2. No Harassment or Threats</h3>
        <p>Respect other users. Personal attacks, harassment, or threats (even as jokes) will result in immediate suspension.</p>

        <h3>3. No False or Misleading Information</h3>
        <p>Posting knowingly false information disrupts discussions and spreads misinformation. Speculation is allowed, but misleading claims as 'fact' will be removed.</p>

        <h3>4. No Doxxing or Sharing Private Information</h3>
        <p>Do not share personal or identifying details (yours or others'). This includes locations, names, or private messages without consent.</p>

        <h3>5. No Excessive Roleplaying</h3>
        <p>While cryptic messages and theories are encouraged, excessive in-character roleplaying disrupts discussions.</p>

        <h3>6. No Spamming or Advertising</h3>
        <p>Repeatedly posting the same content, linking to unrelated sites, or advertising services/products is not allowed.</p>

        <h3>7. No Unauthorized Ritual Discussions</h3>
        <p>Any discussions regarding real-world rituals, summoning, or unsafe experiments will be locked or removed.</p>

        <h3>8. No AI-Generated or Fabricated Evidence</h3>
        <p>AI-created images, deepfakes, or altered media presented as 'real evidence' will be deleted.</p>

        <h3>9. Respect Archive Integrity</h3>
        <p>Editing or deleting old posts to alter narratives is prohibited. Users found doing so will have their accounts flagged.</p>

        <h3>10. Report Suspicious Activity</h3>
        <p>If a post or user seems harmful, report it instead of engaging.</p>

        <h2>Moderation & Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Violating the rules may result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans depending on severity. Moderators have the final say.</p>
