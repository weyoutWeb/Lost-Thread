    <h1>Tessa</h1>
    <p class="character-description">
      Tessa is a dreamer who was always searching for meaning in forgotten places. Known for her curiosity and kind heart, 
      she often wandered off, finding solace in things others would ignore. But the thread she followed led her down a path 
      few dared to tread.
