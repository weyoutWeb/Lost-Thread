          <p>“Alright, I know disappearing highway exits are a common urban legend, but this is different. I saw Exit 1313. I drove past it. I marked it on my GPS. It was there.”</p>
          <p>“Yesterday, I went back. The exit was gone. Not just missing—a different exit was in its place. The sign now says Exit 47, and it leads to an entirely different road.”</p>
          <p>“I checked old maps. No record of Exit 1313. No archived street view. No mentions online. It’s like it never existed.”</p>
          <p>“Except I remember it.”</p>
          <p>“I stopped at a gas station near where it used to be. Asked the clerk if they knew about it. He gave me a weird look and said, ‘You’re the second person to ask that this week.’”</p>
          <p>“Who was the first?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“The guy looked at me and said, ‘You were.’”</p>
