          <p>“I wasn’t going to post this. But I need someone to know just in case.”</p>
          <p>“A few months ago, I got obsessed with a string of posts about 'doors that don’t belong.' You know the type—back alleyways that weren’t there yesterday, an elevator button for a floor that doesn’t exist, a door in your apartment building that no one ever uses.”</p>
          <p>“I found one.”</p>
          <p>“It was in the stairwell of an old office building. Fifth floor, dead end, no room behind it—just a door. No handle, no sign, no reason to be there.”</p>
          <p>“I knocked. Just once. And I swear… I heard something knock back.”</p>
          <p>“That was three weeks ago. Since then, I’ve started noticing things. My bedroom door is sometimes unlocked in the morning when I KNOW I locked it. My fridge magnets rearrange themselves overnight. Once, I woke up to my phone's voice recorder app running. It had captured two hours of dead silence… except for a whisper at the very end. A voice that sounded almost, but not quite, like mine.”</p>
          <p>“Last night, I went back. The door was open.”</p>
          <p>“I didn’t go inside. I wanted to. I felt like I was supposed to. But I made myself walk away.”</p>
          <p>“Today, my reflection lagged in the mirror.”</p>
          <p>“If I don’t post again, you’ll know why.”</p>
